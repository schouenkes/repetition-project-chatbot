# Repetition project chatbot

This is a repetition for the second assignment from Technigo (https://github.com/Technigo/project-chatbot/tree/main).
It's to practice basic JavaScript, interacting with the DOM and how to create and use functions.

### The assignment

The assignment is to build a functional chatbot interface using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The chatbot should interact with users, ask questions, display messages, and respond with precision.

I have created a chatbot to book a movie ticket. 
The user choose a seat on the welcome screen to start the chat and then answers the bots questions regarding genre, movie and time using different form inputs like buttons, select or text input. The options vary depending on the users answers.  When the booking is done the order is shown and the bot is restarting after a few seconds, ready for a new booking.
